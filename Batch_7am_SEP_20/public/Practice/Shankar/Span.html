			In the process, we got a intervention application filed on behalf of one Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch seeking recall of the ban order passed by the Supreme Court. The advocate was one Hitendra Nath Rath. The details in the intervention application were startling. An intervention application was also filed on behalf of Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, thanks to the efforts of Adv. Subhash Jha and Ghanashyam Upadhyay, as also Adv. Sanjiv Punalekar, Secretary of Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad.
