 Parliament Monsoon Session LIVE Updates: Parliament has begun the Monsoon Session with a series of restrictions
 being imposed in order to check further spread of coronavirus. On the second of the Monsoon Session on Tuesday, 
 Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is expected to make a statement on the India-China border standoff. The business 
 agenda for the Lok Sabha session on Tuesday said Rajnath Singh will make a statement in the House on "the 
 developments on our border in Ladakh". The Opposition has been pressing for discussion on the ongoing standoff 
 with China and has made several demands in meetings prior to the session. Ahead of the start of the Monsoon 
 Session on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the media and hoped that parliamentarians would stand 
 behind soldiers guarding India's borders. Also, JDU MP Harivansh Narayana Singh was elected to the post of deputy 
 chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Follow live updates on Parliament session
