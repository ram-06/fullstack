        <ul class="list2">Main Product: AXE</ul>
        <ul class="list3">Review:The fragrance of axe intense is really good but it lasts only for 4-5 hours. On the other hand voyage fragrance lasts much longer than axe. So its better to buy park avenue but If you want to try something else than voyage then Its a good
            to buy.</ul>

        <ul class="inlist3">Review: HRX Edition has the same 0.42-inch OLED display on the front that shows time, steps, distance, calories burnt and battery remaining. The display is sharp and is good indoors, but it is hardly visible outdoors in bright sunlight since it
            is not bright </ul>
