CSS linear gradient helps in adding adding more than one color as background to a container

Following are two type of gradients can be added to a container

	Linear Gradient
	Radial Gradient

Syntax:

	background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color1, color2, color3, ...);

Possible valus for direction:

	to right
	to bottom right
	to left
	etc.

Adding angle as direciton

	eg:
	 background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, pink, yellow);

	 Adding more colors:

		 background-image: linear-gradient(to right, grey,green,yellow,pink,violet,indigo,blue);

Repeating Linear Gradient:

	background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, red 10%, yellow 20%);


Radial Gradient:

	This gets defined based on center of container.

		background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);

		By default radial gradient uses shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.

		Eg:
			 background-image: radial-gradient(pink, yellow, blue);

		with colors a percent

			background-image: radial-gradient(blue 15%, yellow 15%, green 60%);

		Adding Circle as shape:

			 background-image: radial-gradient(circle, green, pink, green);

		Possible valus for position:

			closest-side
			farthest-side
			closest-corner
			farthest-corner

				EG:
					background-image: radial-gradient(closest-side at 60% 55%, pink, yellow, black);
					background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side at 60% 55%, blue, yellow, black);


	Repeating Radial Gradient:

		background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 15%);
