				Online shopping has been known as a rapidly growing business, and although online
				Open Bascket shopping has not followed these same growth patterns in the past, it is now
				being recognized for its potential. As such, the focus of previous online shopping
				research has seldom encompassed this specific retail market, with the existing studies
				focusing essentially on consumers’ motivations and attitudes, rather than how
				consumers actually shop for groceries online. Therefore, this dissertation has the
				objective of uncovering some of the details of consumer decision making processes for
				this specific online retail market, details which can help further both academic research
				and managerial knowledge.<br/>

				The general consumer decision making process is characterized by a pre-decisional, a
				decisional and a post-decisional phase. All of which were addressed in an exploratory
				fashion, through a mixed methods strategy which combined both quantitative and
				qualitative methods of data collection. One of the main results obtained through this
				study is the complementarity of retail channels - as it was found that online grocery
				shopping serves essentially for major shopping trips, being complemented with smaller
				trips to traditional stores. Moreover, some resistance to online grocery shopping,
				specifically the shopping of fresh produce, was also still found among the Portuguese
				population. Additionally, based on two of the main consumer shopping orientations
				which shape online grocery shopping, price-sensitivity and convenience, this study
				uncovered consumer groups which presented distinguishable shopping strategies. These
				strategies are in general very focused and rational, and vary essentially based on the
				shopper’s more prominent shopping orientation. Moreover, all consumer types were
				found to have general negative responses to online stimuli present during shopping.
				Thus, this dissertation contributed to the knowledge of consumer decision making
				processes for online grocery shopping, making wave for new and further researches in
				this field and contributing to managerial knowledge.<br>
