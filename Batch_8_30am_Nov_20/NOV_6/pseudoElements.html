		<h2>News Heading</h2>
		<p>
			News constantly develops, so content on your site can be regularly updated. This is good for search engine optimization, especially since major search engines have web indexing systems that make frequent updates – like Google Caffeine.
			Plus, the continuous nature of news allows for consistent coverage of ongoing stories (and ongoing stories are the ones most frequently shared on the web). News content marketing brings your online audience back to your site to follow the latest developments and establishes your brand as a thought leader.
